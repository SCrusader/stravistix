		<h2 class="mat-headline">Principles</h2>
		In simplified terms, each efforts made involves different levels of fatigue depending on stress you put in.
		Your body reacts to these solicitations and makes you "stronger" for the following efforts.
		Through all these efforts you create a "background training base" over time called "fitness".
		To put numbers on fitness and fatigue over time, every efforts have to be measured. To measure an activity
		effort, stress
		scores are being used.<br/><br/>

		It exists several recognized stress scores calculation methods for an activity depending on available sensors
		(they are detailed in a further section).

		<ul>
			<li>
				Using a Heart Rate Monitor:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Training Impulse (TRIMP)</i>. Represents a training load based on your activity heart rate
						data. It depends on exercise duration and intensity.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Heart Rate Stress Score (HRSS)</i>. Based on <i>TRIMP</i>, <i>HRSS</i> also represents a
						training load based on your activity heart rate data.
						<i>HRSS</i> is more accurate than <i>TRIMP</i> it-self. The use of <i>HRSS</i> is recommend over
						<i>TRIMP</i> in fitness trend.
						Note that <i>HRSS</i> is equivalent to <i>HrTSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Using a Cycling Power Meter:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Power Stress Score (PSS)</i>. Calculated from workout moving duration and athlete <i>Cycling
						Functional Threshold Power (FTP)</i>. Note that <i>PSS</i> is equivalent to <i>TSS&reg;</i> from
						TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Without sensors:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Swimming Stress Score (SSS)</i>: Calculated from workout moving duration, distance and
						athlete <i>Swimming Functional Threshold Pace (SFTP)</i>. Note that <i>SSS</i> is equivalent to
						<i>sTSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>

		Each activity having a stress score is a kind of "impulse" causing its own amount of fatigue and fitness
		background. Fatigue is easy to understand: It's the tired feelings which limits your performance.
		Fitness is basically the foundations, the potential availability of the athlete... You can't get into big
		rides/runs or races without a minimum of fitness acquired.<br/><br/>

		All these "impulses" can be entered in a mathematical impulse-response model which provide a "view" of the
		fatigue and fitness over time. This model is the "fitness trend" also called "Performance Management Chart" in
		TrainingPeaks&trade;.

		<!--<h2 class="mat-headline">Fitness, Fatigue and Form</h2>-->
		<!--As mentioned earlier the fitness trend graph provides a measure of your <i>Fatigue</i> and <i>Fitness</i> over time.-->
		<!--But it also provide a measure of your <i>Form</i> over time. The <i>Form</i> can indicates if you are in over-training,-->
		<!--<h3 class="mat-title">Fatigue</h3>-->
		<!--<h3 class="mat-title">Fitness</h3>-->

		Fitness is basically the foundations, the potential availability of the athlete... You can't get into big
		rides/runs
		or races without a minimum of fitness acquired. If that curve is too regular or too flat, it is not usually a
		sign of good training. <br/><br/>

		Fatigue is easy to understand: It's the tired feelings which limits your performance. This curve varies much
		faster than <i>Fitness</i> curve. On <i>Fatigue</i> curve, you will see the fatigue climbing sharply in response
		where you performed workouts with a high stress. But also go down quickly as you take few days off.

		<!--The <i>Form</i> represents you if you are-->

		<h3 class="mat-headline">Heart Rate Stress Score (all workout types)</h3>
		A heart rate stress is represented by a value called <i>Training Impulse</i> or <i>Training Impulse</i>.
		Training Impulse
		concept has been developed by Dr. Eric W. Banister. Basically, it represents the amount of heart stress during
		an activity: the longer you go at full throttle during an activity, the more <i>Training Impulse</i> of activity
		goes up!
		<i>Training Impulse</i> has both a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is called <i>fitness</i>,
		and the negative effect is called <i>fatigue</i>. <i>Fitness</i> and <i>fatigue</i> can combined to provide a
		value of <i>form</i> & <i>Performance</i>.<br/><br/>

		<i>Training Impulse</i> is defined by:<br/><br/>

		<katex
			[expression]="'Training Impulse = \\displaystyle\\sum_{t=0_{min}}^t{\\delta t~\\times~HRR~\\times~0.64^{k~\\times~HRR}}'"></katex>
		with
		<katex [expression]="'k=1.92'"></katex>
		for mens,
		<katex [expression]="'k=1.67'"></katex>
		for womens
		and
		<katex [expression]="'HRR=\\frac{HR~-~HR_{rest}}{HR_{max}~-~HR_{rest}}'"></katex>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="mat-headline">Power Stress Score (cycling only)</h3>
		If you own a power meter and you activated the cycling power meter option in the feature, then the "Power Stress
		Score (PSS)" will be used instead of <i>Training Impulse</i> on cycling activities only if available.
		<br/><br/>

		<i>Power Stress Score</i> is defined by:<br/><br/>
		<katex
			[expression]="'PSS=\\frac{EffortInSeconds~\\times~WeigthedPower~\\times~Intensity}{Cycling FTP~\\times~3600}~\\times~100'"></katex>

        </div>-->

	<div>
		<h3 class="mat-headline">Swimming Stress Score</h3>
		A "Swimming Stress Score" (Swim SS) can be computed for each of your swim activities if your "Swimming
		Functional Threshold Pace" (Swim FTP) has been entered inside athlete settings and you enabled swimming stress
		score option. No heart rate monitor is required. Even a swimming manual activity will be handled by the
		system.<br/><br/>

		<i>Swimming Stress Score</i> is defined by:<br/><br/>
		<katex [expression]="'Swimming Stress Score=Intensity^3~\\times~TotalTimeInHours~\\times~100'"></katex>
		<br/><br/>
		with
		<katex [expression]="'NormalizedSwimSpeed=\\frac{DistanceMeter}{TimeNoRestInMinutes}'"></katex>
		and
		<katex [expression]="'Intensity=\\frac{NormalizedSwimSpeed}{Swim~FTP}'"></katex>
		<br/><br/>

		<i>Note: Strava do not support HR data for swimming activities at the moment. In the case where you have
			HRM while swimming and strava finally support HR data then <i>Training Impulse</i> value will be used

	<h3 class="mat-headline">Reading Curves</h3>
	<div>
		The Fitness, Fatigue and Form graph and table is based off an impulse-response model first developed by Dr. Eric
		W. Banister in 1975. It was later redefined by <!--<a href="http://www.peakscoachinggroup.com/DrAndrewCoggan"
														  target="_blank">Andrew R. Coggan</a>.-->
		This model will show you:
		<ul>
			<li>Your <i>Fitness</i> based on your chronic load</li>
			<li>Your <i>Fatigue</i> based on your acute load</li>
			<li>Your <i>Form</i> or stress balance</li>
		</ul>

		At a glance

		<ul>
			<li>
				The <i>Fitness</i> curve is the long-term average daily training load. Default period is fixed to 42
				days (or six weeks), so it will take ~6 weeks for your <i>Fitness</i> to be accurate. It's basically the
				foundations, the potential availability of the athlete... You can't get into big rides/runs or races
				without a minimum of fitness acquired. If that curve is too regular or too flat, it is not usually a
				sign of good training.
			</li>

			<li>
				The <i>Fatigue</i> curve is the short-term average daily training load. Same way than <i>Fitness</i> but
				default period is fixed to 7 days (one week). Conceptually, fatigue is easy to understand: It's the
				tired feelings which limits your performance. This curve varies much faster than <i>Fitness</i> curve.
				On <i>Fatigue</i> curve, you can see the fatigue climbing sharply in response where you performed
				workouts with a high stress. But also go down quickly as you take few days off.
			</li>

			<li>
				The <i>Form</i> curve is simply the difference between <i>Fitness</i> and <i>Fatigue</i>, it's the right
				balance of stress you should look at to avoid over training for example.
				<div>
					<i>Form = Fitness - Fatigue</i>
				</div>

				When:
				<ul>
					<li><i>+25 < Form :</i> Transition zone. Athlete is on form. Case where athlete has an
						extended break. (e.g. illness, injury or end of the season).
					</li>
					<li><i>+5 < Form < +25 :</i> Freshness Zone. Athlete is on form. Ready for a race.</li>
					<li><i>-10 < Form < +5 :</i> Neutral Zone. Zone reached typically when athlete is in a rest
						or recovery week. After a race or hard training period.
					</li>
					<li><i>-30 < Form < -10 :</i> Optimal Training Zone.</li>
					<li><i>Form < -30 :</i> Over Load Zone. Athlete is on overload or over-training phase. They
						should take a rest!
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

				Be fit doesn't mean you are ready to race at your higher level. A negative <i>Form</i> would reveal that
				you are carrying fatigue and are not on form. By resting you can remove fatigue faster than you lose
				fitness and come into form for your race day (or punish friend day... ;))!
